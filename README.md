# Splunk Cluster Architecture on AWS for Security Monitoring

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable Splunk Cluster Architecture hosted on AWS for centralized log management and real-time security monitoring. This system will ingest and process network security alerts from Snort IDS and DHCP logs from a Wi-Fi router. By leveraging the power of AWS infrastructure, this setup aims to provide robust and fault-tolerant data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities, enhancing threat detection and network performance monitoring.

REF 1 - SPLUNK CLUSTERED ARCHITECTURE


This project will provide a comprehensive understanding of both security monitoring and cloud-based architecture, allowing for the development of a flexible and scalable solution for real-time network analysis and threat detection.

## Skills Learned:

- Splunk Cluster Setup on AWS: Hands-on experience with deploying a distributed Splunk architecture on AWS, utilizing EC2 for compute resources.
- Data Ingestion: Configured Splunk to ingest and process various log formats, including Snort IDS alerts and router's DHCP logs.
- Security Monitoring and Analysis: Created dashboards and visualizations for monitoring security threats, network anomalies, and performance metrics.
- AWS Cloud Architecture: Gained expertise in setting up cloud-based infrastructure on AWS to support high availability and scalability of the Splunk cluster.
- Performance Optimization: Optimized Splunk's performance for high-volume log ingestion, ensuring smooth operations in a cloud-based, distributed environment.

## Tools Used:
- Splunk: For setting up a clustered architecture, log ingestion, parsing, and visualization.
- Snort IDS: For generating network intrusion detection alerts.
- Wi-Fi Router (DHCP Logs): To collect and process DHCP logs for monitoring network activity.
- Linux/Unix Servers: Used for configuring Splunk components on both on-premise and cloud environments.
- Splunk Apps/Technology Add-ons (TAs): Used for simplifying the integration of Snort and DHCP logs with Splunk.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Utilized AWS EC2 for scalable compute resources and other AWS services to manage and scale the architecture efficiently in the cloud.

###### NOTES ON SNORT
- Enter "man snort" on the terminal to read the manual for Snort which is really helpful to understand it's options
- We can create and customize our own rules in etc/snort/rules/local.rules file
- If you need any help in creating snort rules, go to https://snorpy.cyb3rs3c.net/ for a snort rules creator
