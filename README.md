# Splunk Cluster Architecture on AWS for Security Monitoring

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable Splunk Cluster Architecture hosted on AWS for centralized log management and real-time security monitoring. This system will ingest and process network security alerts from Snort IDS and DHCP logs from a Wi-Fi router. By leveraging the power of AWS infrastructure, this setup aims to provide robust and fault-tolerant data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities, enhancing threat detection and network performance monitoring.

REF 1 - SPLUNK CLUSTERED ARCHITECTURE


This project will provide a comprehensive understanding of both security monitoring and cloud-based architecture, allowing for the development of a flexible and scalable solution for real-time network analysis and threat detection.

## Skills Learned:

- Splunk Cluster Setup on AWS: Hands-on experience with deploying a distributed Splunk architecture on AWS, utilizing EC2 for compute resources.
- Data Ingestion: Configured Splunk to ingest and process various log formats, including Snort IDS alerts and router's DHCP logs.
- Security Monitoring and Analysis: Created dashboards and visualizations for monitoring security threats, network anomalies, and performance metrics.
- AWS Cloud Architecture: Gained expertise in setting up cloud-based infrastructure on AWS to support high availability and scalability of the Splunk cluster.
- Performance Optimization: Optimized Splunk's performance for high-volume log ingestion, ensuring smooth operations in a cloud-based, distributed environment.

## Tools Used:
- Splunk: For setting up a clustered architecture, log ingestion, parsing, and visualization.
- Snort IDS: For generating network intrusion detection alerts.
- Wi-Fi Router (DHCP Logs): To collect and process DHCP logs for monitoring network activity.
- Linux/Unix Servers: Used for configuring Splunk components on both on-premise and cloud environments.
- Splunk Apps/Technology Add-ons (TAs): Used for simplifying the integration of Snort and DHCP logs with Splunk.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Utilized AWS EC2 for scalable compute resources and other AWS services to manage and scale the architecture efficiently in the cloud.

### Setting Up AWS EC2 Instances and Splunk Cluster Architecture 
#### Setting Up the indexer clusters on AWS EC2 instances
- To set up an indexer cluster, we atleast need 2 indexers and 1 cluster master (manager node)
- Let's spin up 3 EC2 instances with the below configuration </br>
  Operating System: Ubuntu </br>
  Instance Type: t2.medium </br>
  Security Group: Keep the same security group you select for all instances </br>
  Configure Storage: 30GiB </br>
  Edit The name Of the Instances to Indexer_1, Indexer_2 and Cluster_Master

REF 29 - Starting EC2 instances on AWS for Indexer Cluster
- As all of the instances are assigned dynamic public IP addresses, we would need static public IP addresses assigned to each of them so that they remain the same even if the instance is restarted
- To assign a static public IP address on AWS, click on Elastic IP's under Network & Security on the options on the left
- Click on Allocate Elastic IP Address and make sure the Network Border Group is set to the same network your instaces is assigned to

- Select one of the allocated IP address and click on Actions > Associate Elastic IP Address
- Select the instance "Indexer_1" and click Associate </br>
Repeat this process until "Indexer_2" and "Cluster_Master" have the associated Elastic IPs
