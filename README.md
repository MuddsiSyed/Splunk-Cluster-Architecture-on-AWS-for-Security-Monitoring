# Splunk Cluster Architecture on AWS for Security Monitoring

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable Splunk Cluster Architecture hosted on AWS for centralized log management and real-time security monitoring. This system will ingest and process network security alerts from Snort IDS and DHCP logs from a Wi-Fi router. By leveraging the power of AWS infrastructure, this setup aims to provide robust and fault-tolerant data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities, enhancing threat detection and network performance monitoring.

REF 1 - SPLUNK CLUSTERED ARCHITECTURE


## Skills Learned:

- Splunk Cluster Setup on AWS: Hands-on experience with deploying a distributed Splunk architecture on AWS, utilizing EC2 for compute resources.
- Data Ingestion: Configured Splunk to ingest and process various log formats, including Snort IDS alerts and router's DHCP logs.
- Security Monitoring and Analysis: Created dashboards and visualizations for monitoring security threats, network anomalies, and performance metrics.
- AWS Cloud Architecture: Gained expertise in setting up cloud-based infrastructure on AWS to support high availability and scalability of the Splunk cluster.
- Performance Optimization: Optimized Splunk's performance for high-volume log ingestion, ensuring smooth operations in a cloud-based, distributed environment.

## Tools Used:
- Splunk: For setting up a clustered architecture, log ingestion, parsing, and visualization.
- Snort IDS: For generating network intrusion detection alerts.
- Wi-Fi Router (DHCP Logs): To collect and process DHCP logs for monitoring network activity.
- Linux/Unix Servers: Used for configuring Splunk components on both on-premise and cloud environments.
- Splunk Apps/Technology Add-ons (TAs): Used for simplifying the integration of Snort and DHCP logs with Splunk.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Utilized AWS EC2 for scalable compute resources and other AWS services to manage and scale the architecture efficiently in the cloud.

## Steps:

### Setting up Splunk Clustered Architecture on Local Machine and AWS EC2 Instances
#### Heavy Forwarder
- Heavy Forwarder will be installed on my local machine (Ubuntu) for this project
- Open Terminal and run the following commands to install Splunk Enterprise
- sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade (To upgrade Ubuntu)
- wget -O splunk-9.2.2-d76edf6f0a15-linux-2.6-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.2.2/linux/splunk-9.2.2-d76edf6f0a15-linux-2.6-amd64.deb" (To Download Splunk DEB File)
- sudo apt install ./splunk-9.2.2-d76edf6f0a15-linux-2.6-amd64.deb (To install Splunk Enterprise)
- sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start â€” accept-license (To accept the license before starting Splunk

REF 4 - Sucessfull Splunk Installation
- If you see the above screen then splunk is successfully installed
- For local computer, we can access the splunk's web interface from http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Log in to splunk's web interface and go to Server Settings > General Settings and enable SSL (HTTPS), save and restart splunk when you get the prompt to restart

REF 7 - Setting up a banner to identify Heavy Forwarder in the cluster architecture
- Now our Heavy Forwarder is ready for configuration

#### Configuring Heavy Forwarder To Receive and Ingest The Data
- I have configured my wireless router to send the DHCP logs through UDP port 514 to 192.168.0.105 (IP address of Heavy Forwarder)
- Let's configure the Heavy Forwarder to receive the logs from the UDP port 514
- Go to Settings > Data Input and click on + Add New for UDP type
